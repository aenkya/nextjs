Fixing Postgres startup after Mac OS shuts down unexpectedly
------------------------------------------------------------

I tried starting [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) and it failed. When I tried accessing postgres via the terminal, it failed too. With a message:

![Error message](/static/images/postgres-macos/2.webp)

As it turns out my mac had shut down unexpectedly. Because Postgres had not shut down correctly, there was still a process running at the default port on which Postgres runs.

To [fix this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37307346/is-the-server-running-on-host-localhost-1-and-accepting-tcp-ip-connections/37307420), go to your terminal and run Postgres: `postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres`

You should be able to see a message like something below

![Raincheck Error](/static/images/postgres-macos/3.webp)

The hint should show what process is blocking that port. Run `kill -9 PID` where PID is the number in the hint.

If there is no error message, you can then try running Postgres again.

You should see log information with Postgresâ€™s recovery steps from your last failure. It should also be able to accept your attempts to connect to the server.

Cheers
